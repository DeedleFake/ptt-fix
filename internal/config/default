# The `key` directive indicates a key to listen for from a device. The
# key is denoted by an integer code. The codes for specific keys can
# be found in /usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h by looking for a
# macro definition that's named like the key you want to use and then
# finding the corresponding number at the end of the line. For
# example, the default, left alt, is 56, and can be found as
# `KEY_LEFTALT` in the aforementioned file.
#
# The value may also be specified in hex, octal, or binary by
# prefixing it with `0x`, `0` or `0o`, or `0b`, respectively.
key 56

# The `sym` directive indicates the symbol to send to the application
# that is listening for push-to-talk events. This symbol is a string
# which corresponds to the macro names in
# /usr/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-keysyms.h. For example, the symbol
# for the default, left alt, is `Alt_L` and the macro listed in the
# aforementioned header file is `XKB_KEY_Alt_L`. Simply find the key
# that you'd like and remove the `XKB_KEY_` prefix.
#
# As a special case, the symbol may instead be in the form
# `mouse:number` where `number` is any integer. This will cause a
# mouse button press to be sent instead. For example, `mouse:2` will
# cause mouse 2, the scroll wheel click, to be sent to the
# application.
sym Alt_L

# The `retry` directive indicates the amount of time to wait before
# retrying a device when it has a potentially temporary error, such as
# having been disconnected from the computer. A value of `0` indicates
# that no retry attempts should be made.
retry 10s

# A `device` directive indicates a glob to use to find device files to
# listen to. This directive may be specified more than once. All
# listed devices will be listened to if they are capable of sending
# the requested key.
